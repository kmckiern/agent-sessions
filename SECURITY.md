# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security issue, please report it privately via GitHub Security Advisories. If that is not available, open a minimal GitHub issue that does **not** include sensitive data and ask for a private contact.

Please do **not** file public issues that include real transcripts, usernames, project names, file paths, secrets, or any personal data.

## Scope

Agent Sessions is a local-only viewer with no authentication layer and no networked services beyond the local HTTP server it starts on your machine. The most likely risks involve accidental disclosure of local transcripts, logs, or cached data.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will respond as quickly as possible.
